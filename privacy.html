                                    issues features within our website. However, we would like to emphasize that as an Administrator we take care to
                                    observe the principle of minimizing and process only those categories of personal data that are necessary for us to
                                    achieve these goals.</li>
                                    <li>10. Each person using our website has a choice whether, and if so, to what extent they want to use our services and
                                        what data about themselves they want to share with us within the scope of this Privacy Policy.</li>
                                        <li>11. When you contact us to perform various activities or to obtain information (e.g., to submit a complaint) using the
                                            Website, telephone, or e-mail, we will again require you to provide us with your personal data to confirm your identity
                                            and the possibility of return contact. This applies to the same personal information you previously provided. However,
                                            it may happen that due to the nature of your request, we will have to collect other data from you. Provision of the
                                            above data is not mandatory, but it is necessary to perform activities or obtain information that interests you. We will process the above-mentioned data to perform the actions requested by you or to provide you with the information
                                            that you requested - depending on which situation takes place.</li>
</ul>



<h5>Processing your data</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1. Your personal data is always processed on one of the legal bases as follows: -<br>
        a) your consent – in the scope resulting from this consent e.g., newsletter subscription, consent is voluntary and
        the consent to the processing of personal data can be withdrawn at any time, we enforce this basis if other
        grounds for the processing of your personal data do not apply, e.g., concluded contract or legal obligation.<br>
        b) an agreement concluded between us (regarding keeping an account on our website, performing a purchase /
        sale transaction, settlements, sending a
        Newsletter, mailing) – in the scope necessary for its implementation.<br>
        c) acting on request, before concluding a contract - if you asked us a question before creating a user account, we
        do not need additional consent to contact you back and answer your questions.<br>
        d) legal obligation, i.e., an obligation arising from legal acts – in the scope necessary to comply with the binding
        provisions.<br>
        e) our legally legitimate interest</li>


        <li>2. If we process your personal data based on the consent referred to in point 1 a) above, the data you provide is used
            only for the purposes covered by your consent. On this basis, we will primarily carry out information and marketing
            campaigns. Remember that at any time you can change your mind and withdraw your consent - just send us an e-
            mail. Please note, however, that this does not always involve the deletion of your personal data. We may still process
            your personal data if it is necessary, e.g., if we have another legal basis for processing your personal data (concluded
            contract) or if we have a legitimate legal obligation to do so.</li>
            <li>3. We will also process your data to execute the agreement we entered with you (primarily because of registration on
                and acceptance of the Terms and Conditions for an account on our website) to be able to properly provide you with
                the services you want.</li>
                <li>4. Whether you have given us your consent for the processing of your personal data, or we are bound with you by a
                    contract, we will also have to process your data due to the need to comply with our legal obligations. These will be
                    situations in which, for example, we must store data resulting from transactions made for tax and accounting reasons;
                    as well as situations where we are obliged to verify and analyse your data (including your actions taken on the
                    Website) in accordance with applicable anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations.</li>

                    <li>5. Please, remember that although you did not give us your express consent, we are obliged to make your personal
                        data available to state authorities, i.e., tax authorities, law enforcement authorities and other entities properly
                        authorized to do so in accordance with applicable law.</li>

                        <li>6. Based on our legitimate interest, we will process your data for the purpose of claiming our rights and defending
                            ourselves against claims, for evidentiary and archival purposes. On the same basis, we will also process your
                            personal data collected automatically on the Website to ensure the security of the session, quality of the session and
                            provide you with all the functions of the Website. On this basis, we will also process your personal data for analytical
                            purposes, which will involve the examination and analysis of traffic on our website.</li>
</ul>


<h5>What are the consequences of not providing us with your data?</h5>

<ul>
    <li>1. In the case of registration and verification of an account, we process only the data without which the agreement
        concluded with you cannot be executed for "technical" reasons or for legal reasons. Not providing us with the required

                    matter.</li>

                        may affect some of the Website's functionalities (for example, it may not be possible to pass the sales offer path due
                        the failure to remember data during the subsequent stapes of submitting offers).</li>

                                domain) to generate statistics helpful in administering the Website. For this purpose, we use services of third parties.
                                Data processed by these entities is aggregate and anonymous, i.e., it does not contain features identifying visitors
                                of the Website.</li>
</ul>

        destruction.</li>
        <li>2. We store, use, and transmit your data in a manner that ensures its proper protection, including protection against
            unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction, or damage, by means of appropriate technical

            <li>3. We have implemented several security measures to ensure that your information will not be lost, used, or changed.
                Our data security measures include, among others: PCI scanning, encryption, pseudonymization, data backup,

                        <li>7. Regardless of the above, please remember that it is impossible to guarantee 100% secure data transmission over
                            the Internet or electronic data storage methods. Therefore, we ask that you also take reasonable precautions to protect your personal data. If you suspect that your personal information has been compromised, the account or
