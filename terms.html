                                <ul>
                                    <li>1. The HIROX Limited points out and warns that the main threat to every Internet user, including
                                        persons using services provided electronically, is the possibility of "infecting" the IT system by
                                        various types of software created mainly to cause damage, such as viruses, Worms, or Trojans. In
                                        order to avoid the risks associated with this, including those that occur when you open an email, it
                                        is important that the User provides its computer which uses an Internet connection with an antivirus
                                        programme and constantly updates it by installing the latest versions of the software as soon as
                                        they are available on the market. The HIROX Limited also informs that threats related to the use of
                                        electronic services, including those described in these Regulations, are related to the activities of so-
                                        called hackers, aimed at breaking into both the HIROX Limited's system (e.g., attacks on its website)
                                        and the Client's system. The Client acknowledges, therefore, that despite the HIROX Limited's use
                                        of various modern "defence" technologies, as described in the Security Policy published on the

                                        published and updated on the Website. The change of the list mentioned above shall not constitute

                that the complaint will be resolved in a specified manner, and an obligation that the User waives all
                claims resulting from it.</li>

<h5>K. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF TERMINATION OF THE SERVICE CONTRACT</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1. The Service Contract shall be terminated upon the User’s request or by the HIROX Limited by notice
        in cases specified in the Regulations</li>
        <li>2. The User being a Consumer has the right to withdraw from the Service Contract without giving a
            reason within 14 days from the date of conclusion of the Contract by submitting a notice of
            withdrawal. By accepting the Regulations, the User agrees that the use of the Services before the
            expiry of the above-mentioned term is tantamount to the expiration of the right of withdrawal from
            the contract.</li>
            <li>3. The User is entitled to terminate the Service Contract with 30 days’ notice period by submitting a
                notice of termination of the Service Contract to the HIROX Limited. The period of notice shall be
                calculated from the date of withdrawal of all funds by the User located on his Account. If it is
                impossible to withdraw or return all funds, the notice period shall be calculated from the last day of
                the month when the termination notice was provided by the User.</li>
                <li>4. The HIROX Limited may terminate the Contract with the User by sending to the User's e-mail address

                            all personal data concerning the User, excluding the data which the HIROX Limited is obliged to store
                            in accordance with the applicable provisions. The User's request to delete personal data is
                            tantamount to termination of the Service Contract by the User</li>
                            <li>7. Withdrawal of funds by the User after issuing termination notice is free, regardless of the current
                                fees and pricing.</li>

        Internet access, power cuts, hacking attacks (despite maintaining adequate measures described
        on the Website), etc.<br>

                    the Website is limited to the value of funds provided by the User for the execution of a given
                    Transaction subject to the preceding section.</li>

                        and that the User cannot recover lost profits, lost business opportunities, etc. Where the applicable
                        legal jurisdiction does not allow for exclusion or limitation of lost profits, the above limitations may
                        not apply.</li>
                        <li>7. The HIROX Limited makes no declarations or assurances that access to the Website or Services in
